# Sudoku-Solver
The Sudoku Solver project is a web-based application designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using HTML, JavaScript, and the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle that requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column and row contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

## How to use:
* Fill the Sudoku grid with random numbers or populate it according to your desired puzzle configuration. Essentially, you are configuring the Sudoku puzzle for the web page to solve. In other words, you are establishing the puzzle's initial state.
* After you have set up the Sudoku grid with your preferred configuration, please click the "Solve!" button.
* Congratulations! Your Sudoku puzzle has been successfully solved. If your input was incorrect, an "Invalid board!" notification will appear. Please try filling it with the correct input.
* Now, you can enjoy the game with various inputs multiple times. To restart the Sudoku grid, simply click the "Clear Board" button.
